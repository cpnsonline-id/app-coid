Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\",\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"Popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset\",\n        superShortContent: _.truncate(\n          'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
